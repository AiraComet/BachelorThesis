\subsection{Mathhub}
\subsection{Previous Implementation}
	Up until April 2018 the Mathhub frontend was realized with Drupal. Drupal is an open source content-management framework used by millions of different websites.
Dealing with user interactions were handled by JavaScript modules in the JOBAD framework \cite{comp}.
	
But in April 2018 a critical security flaw in the versions 6 to 8 went public. The problem was that the Drupal core in these versions accepts request parameters without any validation.
This means the core processes any input from anybody \cite{zdnet}.
To exploit this weakness an attacker doesn't even need to log in or have any other privileges on a vulnerable website \cite{register}.
With this flaw it is possible to inject malicious code and compromise a website in multiple ways. This can be used to access, change and delete private data and create backdoors to make future attacks possible. The Drupal community called this weakness "Drupalgeddon2" while its official name was "CVE-2018-7600". Some code that was injected installed the program XMRig Monero miner, which is a cryptocurrency mining program, as well as deleting other mining programs on the compromised system \cite{hacker}.
The National Institute of Standards (NIST) and Technology gave Drupal a "Highly Critical" Rating because of this vulnerability \cite{nist}.
 After this flaw was discovered a patch was published and a warning to update every website that used a vulnerable version was given.
	
Since this was not the first detected flaw in Drupal the decision to stop using it and rebuild Mathhub from the ground up to not be affected by future attacks was made.

\section{Preliminaries}
	\subsection{The core concept of React} 
	React is an open source JavaScript library owned and maintained by Facebook.	It was created to build interactive user interfaces (UI). For example it is used for Facebook and Instagram. What makes React unique is its use of a virtual Document Object Model (DOM). The concept of the virtual DOM is that when updating a website not everything is rendered again. React computes the differences between the last and the next page and only changes the necessary parts. On top of that it has conditional rendering which means that an item will only be rendered if it is shown. The advantage of virtual and conditional rendering is that this makes updating a website fast, but it comes with high RAM costs. The actual interface is made up of many different elements and components. Since a website that uses React can have many different features it is helpful to build new components. 
\cite{reactjs}
	
	
	\subsection{Building new components in React}
	React already has a large library with a lot of different components, but it is often necessary to make new ones that have the desired functionality. In JavaScript new components can be implemented by creating either a function or a class. Their input variables are called props and can only be read. Components return React elements that are ready to be rendered. Naturally a component can grow big rather quickly. Luckily it is possible to use components inside other components. This comes with the advantage that they can be reused in many different locations. The difference between creating a new component as a function and as a class is that a class can have a private internal state, which can be updated an any time. Since props are read-only, updating the state can only affect lower components. If it is necessary to also change something in a higher component it is possible to "lift up" the state. This means adding the state that causes the change to the state of the component on a higher level and giving it back to the lower levels as a prop. If the update should affect a component on the same level creating a new component with that state that consist of all the one that are affected will  make this possible.
\cite{reactjsGS}

\subsection{MMT and OMDoc}
\begin{itemize}
\item OMDoc: XML format of how a uniform language for knowledge should be designed
\item MMT is a scalable Module System for Mathematical theories
\item MMT is a framework for knowledge representation using formal languages
\item individual features are defined as reusable modules -> create individual languages
\item high degree of abstraction of advanced algorithms
\item archives: correspond to software projects; work flows for languages in MMT
\item groups / libraries: collection of archives
\item module: theory or view
\item view: relations between theories
\item theory: defined by declarations
\item declaration: constants and rules
\item groups and archives just for narration
\item modules and declarations are actual content
\cite{mmt}
\end{itemize}

\ednote{look for author and user pictures}
\begin{itemize}
\item React for building pages and interaction with the backend/MMT
\item Semantic UI React for theming
\item In the web-based system, semantic services (notation-based, presentation, definition lookup, relational navigation, dependency management, etc.) are provided by MMT and are made available to the user, primarily by dedicated React components.
\item Gitlab used for versioned storage of the content documents, and organizes them into repositories
\item conversion to OMDoc
\item OMDoc functionalities and semantics for presentation
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Routes to every step in the MMT Library
\item groups and archives no actual content only for navigation purposes
\item Documents are a list of actual content like theories and declarations
\item own page for Library $\rightarrow$ archives $\rightarrow$ documents
\item some Legal stuff (Licenses and Privacy Policy)
\item Log
\end{itemize}
With the huge mathematical library of theories there are a lot of technical terms. The glossary is a collection of these expressions. There wouldn't be much value in to just having a collection without any additional features. So the glossary also provides a definition for each term. Many different authors have contributed to the theories, so it can happen that there are different terms that share a meaning. These synonyms can also be found in the glossary. Since many theories exist in multiple languages it makes sense to have a glossary available for the used languages. Currently the biggest collection of terms are in the English glossary, followed by German and French. Smaller collections for Turkish and Romanian are also available as well as simplified and traditional Chinese.


Most of the times a user does not want to browse through the gigantic glossary to just find a single term. This is the reason why the Math Dictionary is a useful extension of the glossary.
The main purpose of the Math Dictionary is to translate a term into another language.

\section{Mathhub Components}
\ednote{what exactly have I done in the Frontend with these}
\ednote{don't go into to much detail about the implementation; eg entry has own react component is okay but don't talk about cards and stuff}
\ednote{get some nice screen shots}
\subsection{Groups}
\begin{itemize}
\item link to source on gl.mathhub.info
\item description text of the group
\item list of archives in the group with short teaser
\item every archive is a React component
\end{itemize}	 
	
\subsection{Archives}
\begin{itemize}
\item link to source on gl.mathhub.info
\item description text of the group
\item list of the documents in the archive
\end{itemize}	 

\subsection{Documents}
\begin{itemize}
\item extendable modules
\item extension shows declarations like structure and constants
\item opaque elements: text for humans
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
\item groups, archives and documents can have statistics
\item visible by button
\item popup for explanation of keywords
\end{itemize}

\section{The Applications of Mathhub}
	\subsection{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Different language tabs
\item only language relevant terms are rendered
\end{itemize}
In the frontend it is possible to change languages by either changing the language tab or clicking on a language button inside an entry. If there is a button with a different language available, this means this particular entry also exists in this language. The definition of a term is not immediately shown to create a better overview. To makes the definition visible the user can click on the entry. 

 	\subsection{Math Dictionary}
To translate a term with the help of the Math Dictionary so the user has to select the language in which the term currently is and also the language to which should be translated into. Pressing the "translate" - button sends a translation request to the server. Until the servers responds the message "translating" is shown and the button is disabled to prevent sending to many translation requests. If a translation exists then the translated term, its definition and potential synonyms are shown.
By selecting the same language for "from" and "to" the Math Dictionary can also be used to get the definition for an expression without searching the glossary.
